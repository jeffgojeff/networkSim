Distance Vector Simulator

Project 1


compile: g++ dvSim.cpp -o dvSim
run: dvSim <topologyFilename>

This program simulations distance vector routing, and outputs 
the final table of all converged nodes. It accepts a txt file input.
I left a few functions in there that i used to help find seg errors,
and to help me see the data coming / going from the ques to each 
node.
